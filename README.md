# Simple Shell Project

## What is the shell?
The shell is a program that takes commands from the keyboard via the terminal, and gives them to the operating system to perform.\

## About this project
This project is a simple version of the linux shell made for [Holberton School] taking part of the "Low-level programming & Algorithm - Linux and Unix system programming" projects.\
It is created using the **C programming Language** and it can do many functionalities that a real shell does.

## Essential Functionalities of the Simple Shell:
 Displays a prompt "#╰═┅═━–〈KENNETH ┈➤" and waits for user input.\
 Runs all commands of type "executable program" (ls and /bin/ls).\
 Handles commands with arguments.\
 Handles the PATH global variable.\
 Handles The EOF (End Of File) condition.\
 Handles the Ctrl + C signal -> It doesn't exit the shell
